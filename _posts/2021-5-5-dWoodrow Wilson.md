### Who? Brief bio ###
Woodrow Wilson, one of perhaps the biggest names to have presided over Princeton University’s campus was also a controversial figurehead during and after the era of the Civil War. Born in Virginia in 1856, Wilson became an undergraduate student at Princeton and then attended University of Virginia Law School as well as earning his doctorate from Johns Hopkins. Becoming a conservative professor of political science, he then rose to the rank of President of Princeton University in 1905. In the year of 1912 he was nominated for President of the United States and campaigned a program of New Freedom focused on state and individual rights. Winning an overwhelming electoral vote, Wilson’s legacy in the Oval Office was the passing of three major legislations through Congress and his asking Congress to declare war on Germany in 1917. Only a year later, he flew to Paris to promote peace and sign the Treaty of Versailles, soon after he suffered a stroke he was nursed back to health by his second wife, living until 1924. Wilson is survived by the previously named Woodrow Wilson School of Public and INternational Affairs (now the School of Public and International Affairs) as well as a residential college (now named First College). These name changes were made due to the uncovering of Wilson’s racist tendencies and segregation policies, he is recognized from current President Eisgruber of Princeton as someone who turned the University into a great research facility.
