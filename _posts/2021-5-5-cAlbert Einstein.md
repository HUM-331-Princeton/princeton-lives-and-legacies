### Who? Brief bio ###
Albert Einstein needs next to no introduction, born March 14th, 1879 in Germany, Einstein’s life became known throughout the world for his work as the most infamous theoretical-physicist. As a child, Einstein’s education moved around due to his father’s business failures but eventually he landed at a special high school in Switzerland run by Jost Winteler. After graduation, he was turned down at all academic positions he applied for. Originally ignored, Einstein’s physics papers caught the eye of another world-renowned scientist Max Planck and he was offered a series of teaching positions at various Universities. Interrupted by World War I, Einstein revoked his German citizenship and fled to the United States, landing in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. At this point in his life and career, Einstein had already won a Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect and was suffering familial troubles with his second wife and son. In 1939, Einstein wrote the infamous letter regarding the creation of the atomic bomb. Having led a complicated and lengthy life, Einstein is survived by his Theory of Relativity and other scientific breakthroughs as well as his family and buildings at Princeton University.
