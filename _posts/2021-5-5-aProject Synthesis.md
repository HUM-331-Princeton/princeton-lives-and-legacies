### Who do we choose from history to build a legacy for, and why? ### <!--more-->

This page includes our answers to this question after we finalized this digital project.

A Note from Savannah:
Attempting to answer this posed question as the co-creator of the site Princeton Lives and Legacies, I am urged to say that it still remains slightly unanswered. While we brought to life the stories of five unique individuals who each made their mark on the history of Princeton, and who the archival libraries will keep alive in years to come, there was no significant factor beneath the legacy of these individuals. All hailing from different lifestyles, upbringings, and heritages, our five alumni shared nothing but the fact that they associated themselves with this University and had a passion for what they loved and stood for. Going into this project with the hopes of synthesizing a factual answer to why history highlights certain people, we have come out with an answer that may be unsatisfactory but is equally compelling. Raising its own questions for further research, the answer I found while working through this assignment is that every giant in history has more sides than what may be present, and it is essential to dig a little deeper and review the intersection of their public and private selves.
With high hopes of role models throughout history who are showcased as real, genuine, and human in the near and far future, 
Savannah
